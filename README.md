# Tinybird GitHub Action Push
This action allows you to push changes to your Tinybird data project.

It will detected **changed files from the latest commit** that triggered the action, and push those changes.

If you need more options, you can use the Tinybird CLI action and pass the arguments you need: [https://github.com/alejandromav/tinybird-action-push](https://github.com/alejandromav/tinybird-action-push)

## Usage
To use the action simply create an `*.yml` file in the `.github/workflows/` directory. Ref. https://docs.github.com/es/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions

For example, this will push your latest changes to Tinybird:

```yaml

  push:
    branches:
    - master
    - main
    - stable
